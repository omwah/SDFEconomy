SDFEconomy
==========

SDFEconomy is a multiverse/location aware Vault based economy plugin used on the [SDF Minecraft Server](http://sdf.org/?minecraft). The plugin can configured to have separate economies corresponding to the separate inventory locations from any of these plugins:

* [Multiverse-Inventories](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiverse-inventories/)
* [MultiInv](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiinv/) 
* [WorldInventories](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/world-inventories/)
* [My Worlds](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/my-worlds/)

In addition to multiverse support there are options for having an economy per world or a single economy for all worlds.

As Vault is not itself multiverse aware, we sometimes need to add specific support for other Vault plugins so money is placed in the correct location. So far we support:  

* [ChestShop](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/chestshop/)
* [Factions](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/factions/)
* [Towny / Towny Advanced](http://palmergames.com/)

You will need at least [Vault version 1.2.3](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/files/37-vault-1-2-23/) or higher to use this plugin.

Localization is supported by this plugin. So far we have localization for:

* English
* Russian

Builds can be found on the [Bukkit Page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/sdfeconomy/).

Known caveats
-------------

ChestShop through Vault checks the last location of an offline player or
current location of an online player to see if they have enough money to
buy items instead of directly using the location of the shop.
